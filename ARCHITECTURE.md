# Cody Verse Platform Architecture

## System Overview

The Cody Verse platform is built using a modern, scalable architecture designed for high performance and reliability. The system follows microservices principles with a monolithic deployment for simplicity.

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+ with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Cache**: In-memory caching with TTL management
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0 with Swagger UI
- **Monitoring**: Winston logging with real-time metrics

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features
- **Styling**: CSS3 with responsive design patterns
- **UI Components**: Custom components with progressive enhancement

## Core Architecture Patterns

### Service Layer Pattern
```
├── controllers/           # Request handling and routing
├── services/             # Business logic and data processing
├── core/                 # Shared infrastructure components
├── server/               # Server configuration and middleware
└── shared/               # Common schemas and utilities
```

### BaseService Pattern
All services extend the BaseService class providing:
- Consistent error handling
- Performance metrics tracking
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Caching capabilities with intelligent TTL

### BaseController Pattern
Controllers implement standardized:
- Request validation and sanitization
- Response formatting
- Error response generation
- Logging and monitoring integration

## Database Architecture

### Schema Design
- **Users**: Core user authentication and profile data
- **Courses**: Educational content structure and organization
- **Gamification**: XP, levels, badges, goals, and rewards
- **Progress**: Learning progress tracking and analytics
- **Notifications**: User engagement and communication

### Performance Optimizations
- Connection pooling with circuit breakers
- Query result caching with intelligent invalidation
- Batch operations for bulk data processing
- Database migrations with Drizzle Kit

## Security Implementation

### Request Security
- Rate limiting: 200 requests/minute per IP
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- Helmet.js for security headers
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Protection
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection via content security policies
- Error message sanitization to prevent information leakage

## Performance Architecture

### Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Multi-level caching implementation
const cacheService = {
  userDataTTL: 10 minutes,
  courseDataTTL: 15 minutes,
  staticDataTTL: 60 minutes,
  apiResponseTTL: 5 minutes
}
```

### Connection Management
- Database connection pooling (5-20 connections)
- Circuit breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Graceful degradation under high load
- Health checks every 30 seconds

### Response Time Optimization
- Target: <60ms for API responses
- Cache hits: <10ms response time
- Database queries: <50ms execution time
- Static content: <5ms delivery time

## Monitoring and Observability

### Real-time Metrics
- Request/response tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- Memory usage analysis
- Database performance metrics

### Health Monitoring
```javascript
{
  overall: "healthy|degraded|critical",
  database: "connected|disconnected|timeout",
  memory: "optimal|warning|critical",
  cache: "operational|degraded|offline"
}
```

### Performance Dashboards
- System monitoring: Real-time resource usage
- API analytics: Endpoint performance and error rates
- User analytics: Engagement and learning metrics

## API Design Principles

### RESTful Architecture
- Resource-based URLs
- HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- Consistent response formats
- Proper status code usage

### Response Standardization
```javascript
// Success Response
{
  success: true,
  data: {},
  message: "Operation completed",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T12:00:00.000Z"
}

// Error Response
{
  success: false,
  error: "Error description",
  code: "ERROR_CODE",
  timestamp: "2025-06-12T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Gamification Engine

### Core Components
- **XP System**: Experience points with level progression
- **Achievement Engine**: Badge unlocking and reward distribution
- **Goal Management**: Daily objectives and progress tracking
- **Notification System**: Real-time user engagement alerts

### Calculation Algorithms
```javascript
// XP Calculation
const xpAwarded = baseXP + (timeSpent * timeMultiplier) + (score * scoreMultiplier);

// Coin Calculation
const coinsAwarded = baseCoins + (timeSpent * coinTimeMultiplier) + (score * coinScoreMultiplier);

// Level Progression
const requiredXP = [0, 100, 300, 600, 1000, 1500, 2500, 4000];
```

## Deployment Architecture

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Local PostgreSQL with debug logging
- Staging: Cloud database with performance monitoring
- Production: Clustered deployment with load balancing

### Scaling Strategy
- Horizontal scaling via multiple server instances
- Database read replicas for query distribution
- CDN integration for static content delivery
- Auto-scaling based on resource utilization

## Error Handling Strategy

### Error Categories
1. **Validation Errors**: Input validation failures
2. **Business Logic Errors**: Application rule violations
3. **System Errors**: Infrastructure and connectivity issues
4. **External Service Errors**: Third-party API failures

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker activation for failing services
- Graceful degradation with fallback responses
- Comprehensive error logging and alerting
